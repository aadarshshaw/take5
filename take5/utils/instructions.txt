===== Welcome to Take 5! =====

🎯 Goal:
- Avoid collecting penalty points (bulls 🐂)!
- The player with the fewest bulls at the end wins.

🃏 Game Overview:
1. Each player starts with a hand of cards.
2. All players select one card simultaneously per round.
3. Cards are placed on one of four rows on the board.
4. Cards are placed in ascending order, after the closest smaller card.
5. If your card is smaller than the last card of every row, you must take a row.

🔄 Example 1:
Rows:
[12]
[25]
[36]
[48]

You play: 30  
→ Your card goes after [25] because it's the closest smaller number.
→ That row becomes: [25, 30]

🔄 Example 2:
Rows:
[72]
[68]
[61]
[53]

You play: 45  
→ Your card is smaller than all last cards.
→ You must choose a row to take and replace.
→ The taken row’s cards are added to your penalty pile.

🏁 Ending:
- The game ends when someone reaches the max penalty points.
- The player with the least penalty points wins!
